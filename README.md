### 📌 Featured Projects
- 🔹 Project 1 – Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Motors: A system developed by integrating hardware and software such that the failures and faults in the motors would be predicted even before they occur!For hardware, STM32 nucleo F446ZE was used along with sensors like ACS712, ADXL345 & DHT22 as the parameters used were Current, Vibration, Temperature and Humidity respt. Hardware was coded on Arduino IDE and for backend Python was used. Software tech stack used was React Native, HTML, CSS,JS Python, Databases: Kaggle, MySQL and finally, the real time data received on the serail monitor of Arduino IDE was displayed on the dashboard made. For mobile display, ExpoGo was used.Main idea was that when the value of any of the parameter exceeds the threshold set, then the alerts would be send accordingly depending upon the conditions: normal, critical, alert!
- 🔹 Project 2 – Tourism Itenarary App- TouriGenie : An interctive application for planning the travel efficiently and reducing the manual effort of switching between multiple apps for hotel bookings, trnasportation, flight bookings etc. All included in a single app along with a language assistant bot!! Tech stack used: HTML, CSS, JS, C++, Python. Databases: MySQL, MongoDB. APIs from Google Maps and ChatGPT.
